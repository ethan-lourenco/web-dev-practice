/* JS Libraries and Frameworks
   - JS libraries and frameworks provide pre-build code that
     streamlines the development process, while both libraries
     and frameworks serve to improve productivity and standardize
     coding practices, they differ in their approach and level of
     control they provide for developers
*/

/* JS Libraries 
   - libraries are generally more focused on providing solutions to 
     specific tasks, such as manipulating the DOM, handling events,
     or managing AJAX requests
*/

/* JS Frameworks 
   - frameworks provide a more defined structure for building apps,
     they often come with a set of rules and conventions that
     developers need to follow
*/

/* Single Page Applications (SPAs)
   - unlike traditional multi-page websites, single page apps load 
     only one HTML page and dynamically update the content as the
     interacts with the app, without reloading the entire page
*/

/* React
   - one of the most popular JS libraries for building user interfaces
     and web applications
*/

/* State
   - refers to the data that determines how a component renders
     and behaves
*/

/* React Components
   - the building blocks of React apps that allow devs to break down
     complex UI into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier to
     develop and maintain large-scale apps, there are Functional and 
     Class Based Components
*/

/* JSX
   - a syntax extension for JS that looks similar to HTML but allows
     you to write UI elements in a more declarative way
*/

// React Component Example
function Greeting() {
  const name = "John";
  {
    /* The result will be Hello John*/
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
      <p>Nice to meet you.</p>
    </>
  );
}

/* To use in app you would write something like this: 
   <Greeting />
*/

/* Vite
   - build tool that aims to provide a faster development experience
     for modern web projects
*/

/* Dependencies
   - libraries or packages that your React project requires 
     in order to function correctly, such as React itself, 
     ReactDOM, or other third-party packages that provide
     additional functionality.
*/

/* package.json
   - a key configuration file in
     projects that contains metadata about your
     project, including its name, version, and
     dependencies. It also defines scripts, licensing
     information, and other settings that help manage
     the project and its dependencies.
